I developed a website for RFC Doggen, a small football club in Erembodegem. This project marked my first real-life experience in web development and was built using the same tech stack as the PGM Platform, including React, CSS Modules (SASS), and GraphCMS for content management. The RFC Doggen website features dynamic pages for players, events, sponsors, rankings, and match results, all managed through Hygraph/GraphCMS. This allows for easy updates and content management by me. The project was particularly valuable in deepening my understanding of SEO and Google Search Console, ensuring that the website is not only functional but also optimized for search engines. This hands-on project provided me with practical insights into deploying a live website and managing real-world client requirements.

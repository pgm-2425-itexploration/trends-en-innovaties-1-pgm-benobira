In this project, I developed "todoo" a comprehensive todo application with full authentication and CRUD functionalities. Users can register, log in, and manage tasks and categories only after authenticating via email and password. The application supports creating, reading, updating, deleting, and archiving tasks, with secure data handling using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and bcrypt for password encryption. The backend was built with Node.js and Express, following the MVC architecture, while the frontend utilized Handlebars for templating. The project emphasizes robust security, user-friendly design, and seamless client-server communication.
